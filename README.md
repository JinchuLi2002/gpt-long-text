# GPT-Long-Text: Enabling Seamless Queries Over Texts of Any Length

## Description

GPT-Long-Text is a Streamlit application that transforms interaction with lengthy text documents, such as textbooks or research papers. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT model and vector storage via Langchain, the application provides concise, accurate responses to user queries. 

<!-- ## Features

1. **Text Splitting**: The app breaks down long documents into manageable chunks and generates embeddings using OpenAI APIs.
2. **Document Summarization**: The application creates summarized versions of the text chunks in a map-reduce manner.
3. **Pinecone Indexing**: The embeddings and summaries are stored in a Pinecone index for efficient searching.
4. **Langchain Similarity Search**: The app employs Langchain to perform a similarity search on the Pinecone index whenever a user input is received.
5. **GPT Integration**: The user's question and the relevant text chunks retrieved from the similarity search are fed into the GPT model to provide a final, comprehensive answer. -->
